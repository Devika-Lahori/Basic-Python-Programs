# Basic-Python-Programs
This repository contains a collection of basic Python tasks completed as part of my learning journey.
These programs are created to practice fundamental puthon concepts.

# aas1_task-1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
The program prompts the user to enter two numerical values.
It calculates the sum,difference,product and quotient.
Displays the result of each operation clearly to the user.

# ass1_task2: Create a Personalized Greeting
This program asks the user to input their first and last name separately.
Uses string concatenation to form the full name.
Greets the user with a warm, personalized message.

# ass2_task1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
This program accepts an integer from the user.
Uses the modulus operator (%) to determine if the number is divisible by 2.
Displays whether the number is even or odd.

# ass2_task2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
This program uses a for loop to go through numbers 1 to 50.
Accumulates the total sum in a variable.
Displays the sum after the loop ends.

# ass3_task1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 
In this program a function factorial(n) is defined.
Inside the function, a loop is used to calculate the factorial of the number.
The result is returned to the caller.

# ass3_task2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
This programs ask the user to enter a integer number.
Imports the built-in math module.
Uses the following math functions: math.sqrt() for square root, math.log() for natural log, math.sin() for sine (in radians)
Prints all results in a clean format.

# ass4_task1: Read a File and Handle Errors
This program attempts to open and read the contents of a text file named 'sample.txt'.
If the file exists, it reads and prints each line with line numbers.
If the file does not exist, it catches the FileNotFoundError and prints an appropriate error message.

# ass4_task2: Write, Append, and Read from a File
This program takes input from the user and writes it to a file named 'output.txt'.
It then prompts the user for additional input to append to the same file.
After writing and appending, the program reads and displays the final content of the file.

# ass5_task1: Retrieve Student Marks from a Dictionary
This program defines a dictionary with student names as keys and their marks as values.
It asks the user to input a student's name.
If the name exists in the dictionary, it prints the corresponding marks.
If the name is not found, it displays a 'Student not found' message.

# ass5_task2: Demonstrate List Slicing and Reversal
This program creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
It extracts the first five elements using list slicing and reverse it using reverse function.
The program prints the original list, the extracted list, and the reversed result in a clear format.
