# Basic-Python-Programs
This repository contains a collection of basic Python tasks completed as part of my learning journey.
These programs are created to practice fundamental puthon concepts.

# aas1_task-1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
The program prompts the user to enter two numerical values.
It calculates the sum,difference,product and quotient.
Displays the result of each operation clearly to the user.

# ass1_task2: Create a Personalized Greeting
This program asks the user to input their first and last name separately.
